# Who Am I ?

## Short

I'm **Freddy AGBONA, fullstack web developer and I love help others and sharing my knowledge ‚ù§Ô∏è**.

Passionate about ICTs with strong problem-solving skills and recognized experience in web application design, I enjoy working in a team and above all contributing to the development of high-impact projects.

I have this ability to get out of the usual **"programmer" or "developer"** environment in order to work on roles ranging from **tech project management (organization of tech events, leading tech projects) to digital marketing (sales tunnel, design, seo )**

I like continuous learning and I adapt quickly.

## A little long

In 2019 I started my adventure on the web. Thanks to the **Openclassroms website**, I discovered programming and became interested in web development.

In 02 years of learning and practice I managed to work on complex website projects with **HTML, CSS, JS, PHP & MYSQL**. This earned me to work with a local company: **[AbuzWeb](https://abuzweb.com)**. I learned a lot by being with them.

In 2021, my thirst for knowledge led me to apply to join the **[Dive Into Code](https://diveintocode.jp/)** web engineering school in Japan. I managed to enter it and I followed the **Ruby on Rails web engineer** course over 06 months. I can say that it was the most intense year of my career. Above all, I learned a lot, in particular by discovering concepts of **clean code, devops, Admin Sys and others**. And the internship that followed allowed me to apply all this.

So I started freelancing and had a lot of clients, so I was able to work on projects as exciting as each other. During this time, I continued to share my knowledge on Facebook, Linkedin and through conferences that I organized and where I was invited. This got me interviewed by Blue-Sydney in 2022.

I created the **"DEV FAQ"** which is a community of developers who learn from each other through public build challenges, conferences and trainings and also via my newsletter.

**[Visit the DEV FAQ here](https://kloo.me/faqdudev)**.

Also in 2022, I won the second prize of Blolab's digital hackathon and co-organized the **[YATS HACKATHON 2022](https://lechasseurinfos.net/yats-hackathon-2022-katre-remporte-premier-prix/)**.

In May 2023 I organized the **[TECH MEETUP 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fredthedev_faqdudev-fredthedev-techmeetup2023-activity-7066353004181905408-7yb4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)** which brought together more than 150 registrants through various themes related to software development, SaaS, artificial intelligence, employability and digital entrepreneurship.

Today, I still continue to learn, train and share. I'm more interested in **FINTECH, AI and SaaS**.




**[Here is my website](https://fredthedev.com)** where I talk shortly about me and I sharing my learning, experiences and knowdlege through my blog. I love write even if it's not on my blog. I share more on my others social networks...
