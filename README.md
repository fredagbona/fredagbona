# Who Am I ?

I'm **Freddy AGBONA, fullstack web developer and I love help others and sharing my knowledge ‚ù§Ô∏è**.

Passionate about ICTs with strong problem-solving skills and recognized experience in web application design, I enjoy working in a team and above all contributing to the development of high-impact projects.

I have this ability to get out of the usual "programmer" or "developer" environment in order to work on roles ranging from tech project management (organization of tech events, leading tech projects) to digital marketing (sales tunnel, design, seo )

I like continuous learning and I adapt quickly.

PHP, AWS, React JS, Vue JS, Node Js, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, Docker, PostgreSQL, MySQL, WordPress and Laravel.

In 2019 I started my adventure on the web. Thanks to the **Openclassroms website**, I discovered programming and became interested in web development.

In 02 years of learning and practice I managed to work on complex website projects with **HTML, CSS, JS, PHP & MYSQL**. This earned me to work with a local company: **[AbuzWeb](https://abuzweb.com)**. I learned a lot by being with them.

In 2021, my thirst for knowledge led me to apply to join the **[Dive Into Code](https://diveintocode.jp/)** web engineering school in Japan. I managed to enter it and I followed the Ruby on Rails web engineer course over 06 months. I can say that it was the most intense year of my career. Above all, I learned a lot, in particular by discovering concepts of clean code, devops, Admin Sys and others. And the internship that followed allowed me to apply all this.

So I started freelancing and had a lot of clients, so I was able to work on projects as exciting as each other. During this time, I continued to share my knowledge on Facebook, Linkedin and through conferences that I organized and where I was invited. This got me interviewed by Blue-Sydney in 2022.

I created the **"DEV FAQ"** which is a community of developers who learn from each other through public build challenges, conferences and trainings and also via my newsletter.

**[Visit the DEV FAQ here](https://kloo.me/faqdudev)**.

Also in 2022, I won the second prize of Blolab's digital hackathon and co-organized the **[YATS HACKATHON 2022](https://lechasseurinfos.net/yats-hackathon-2022-katre-remporte-premier-prix/)**.

In May 2023 I organized the **[TECH MEETUP 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fredthedev_faqdudev-fredthedev-techmeetup2023-activity-7066353004181905408-7yb4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)** which brought together more than 150 registrants through various themes related to software development, SaaS, artificial intelligence, employability and digital entrepreneurship.

Today, I still continue to learn, train and share. I'm more interested in **FINTECH, AI and SaaS**.
